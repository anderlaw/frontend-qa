Install Hugo and make sure it is added to your system's PATH.
Run `hugo version` in the terminal to confirm that Hugo is installed successfully.

## Try to create a Hugo website

```

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

```
- Edit Markdown files to add content.

Check the documentation to view some common instructions, operators, logical structures, attributes, methods, etc., such as `if`, `range`, etc.

## Using Hugo Cli commands

Be familiar with the commands provided by Hugo, such as build, deploy, generate pages, etc. See hugo --help for help.

## Deploy website
