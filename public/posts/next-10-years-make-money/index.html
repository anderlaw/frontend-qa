          <p>When it comes to the industries with the most money-making opportunities, many people will think of the real estate, finance, and IT industries, and they did before.</p>
<p>People who were engaged in real estate in the early days only needed to buy with their eyes closed, and then resell or rent it out. They could make money while lying down, making money passively.</p>
<p>Later, coincident with the rapid development of the financial industry, the financial industry became popular, and wealthy families would do everything possible to make their children
Go study in finance.</p>
<p>Then there is the IT industry. The past ten years have been the era of IT. Forbes Latest
In the top ten richest list, 7 of the top 10 are directly related to the IT industry.</p>
<p>So now, which industries have the potential to become profitable industries in the future?</p>
<h2 id="mind-and-body-industry">Mind and body industry</h2>
<p>You can think of it as divination and fortune-telling in the past, which is very popular among young people today. For example, you can go to the temple to ask for fortune-telling and tell fortunes online.
, or even directly find a famous Internet celebrity or blogger to ask him for help.</p>
<p>In addition to fortune telling, young people also like to read information related to horoscopes, compasses and personality tests.</p>
<p>In fact, these industries are all physical and mental industries. According to statistics, 85% of people in the world have paid for it. And there are many loyal customers.</p>
<p>So why do people have this need?</p>
<p>The reason is simple. In today&rsquo;s society, the pressure of competition is increasing and information is becoming more and more complex. It is becoming easier and easier for us to fall into the trap of
In your own cognitive trap: the more you know, the more confused you become, and you even start to doubt your own knowledge. How to solve this dilemma? We need a sense of certainty and a reason and explanation for everything happening now.</p>
<p>So what exactly is mind, body and soul? To put it simply: it is to be able to heal everyone’s souls, and then provide meditation and solutions. These industries
I call it all mind, body and soul.</p>
<p>For example, relevant business planning can be carried out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides meditation, relaxing music and tools</li>
<li>Aromatherapy, crystal ball, and eye mask to help you sleep</li>
<li>Stress relief. Decompression toys and more.</li>

<p>Personality tests have a range of uses and advantages in personal and professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help individuals gain a more comprehensive understanding of their own personality traits, behavioral tendencies, interests and values. So as to better cope with various challenges in life.</li>

<li>Manage stress better. They can choose coping strategies that suit their personality traits and better cope with challenges</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, relevant business planning can be carried out:</p>

<li>Education and school services: Provide student counseling services based on personality tests for schools and educational institutions to help students better understand themselves and formulate personal academic and career plans</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ai">AI</h2>
<p>AI is developing very rapidly. Although there are still some problems, it has many important implications for all aspects of society and has had a far-reaching impact.</p>
<p>At the same time, AI will not replace humans. It will become a helper for humans, liberating humans from repetitive labor and helping humans create more wealth.</p>
<p>Some people predict that artificial intelligence may dominate the development of society in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>An American internet celebrity embeds ChatGPT’s algorithm into a
Use your own avatar
On top of the created virtual person,
Her clients can hold conversations with her avatars and charge for the sessions. This way, you can make thousands of dollars in a week.</p>
<p>Another example is using “Midjourney” to design an illustration for someone else.
Design pictures for others, pictures that require a lot of designer time, with the help of AI tools,
It takes less than two minutes and is cheap or even free.</p>
<p>Therefore, you don’t need to pay too much attention to the big changes brought about by artificial intelligence. You need to go in and see how artificial intelligence affects your current work.
Or an irreversible change in your industry. For example, in the photo studio industry, its business model has changed. You only need to take 1 or 2 beautiful photos, and with the help of artificial intelligence
You can cut out different looks without spending a lot of time selecting and changing clothes and backgrounds in the past.
All these changes are brought about by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In addition, you have to see where artificial intelligence is changing the structure of the industry. For example, in the past when we were shopping online, Amazon’s customer service could only be one-to-one at most. But today, many online shopping platforms have begun to use artificial intelligence, which can reach a person’s needs in a short period of time.
Have a conversation with 1,000 users.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can solve most problems on the front end. At this time, you must pay attention to this structural change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holistic health&rdquo; is a comprehensive, multi-level health concept that emphasizes comprehensive health in multiple aspects such as physical, mental, social and environmental aspects.</p>
<p>The aging trend of the world is irreversible. In addition, there is a phenomenon of sub-health among young people. They often need to adjust their bodies, such as acupuncture, massage, and even drinking some healthy tea.</p>
<p>The big health industry covers a wide range of areas, and you have to think about what impact it will have on your industry. For example, Japan’s Nintendo Switch
I made a game about &ldquo;Fitness Ring&rdquo;, which was very popular.</p>
<p>There is also the beverage industry. Many beverages now focus on sugar-free. &ldquo;Healthy and green&rdquo; is the development trend of the world. There is a very famous internet celebrity in China who has tens of millions of fans just by teaching fans how to do aerobics.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s online world, as long as you can find users&rsquo; pain points in health, you can accurately acquire customers, and the threshold is very low.</p>
<p>You can develop a health management app, provide users with personalized nutrition planning, health education games, etc.</p>
<h2 id="parenting-industry">Parenting industry</h2>
<p>Although the birth rate is declining in many countries and regions, as the quality of the population improves, parents will have a stronger willingness to pay attention to and cultivate the comprehensive development needs of their children, and they will also be willing to spend more money on their children.</p>
<p>There are also many &ldquo;parenting&rdquo; products and services on the market, such as some mobile applications and online platforms, smart parenting equipment, and smart parenting communities.</p>
<p>For example, there is a product that provides consulting services and trains parents to put their children to sleep, and it is expensive.</p>
<p>The recently popular study tour program provides summer camp services for children, including visiting various theme parks, visiting famous institutions of higher learning, such as Stanford and Harvard, and experiencing the atmosphere of first-class universities. The cost is not high, but the price is tens of thousands.</p>
<p>The reason why the parenting industry is popular is that in today&rsquo;s era, many young parents lack parenting experience and are stressed and prone to anxiety, which brings business opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s era of rapid information change, you must stay calm and think independently, learn to use the Internet, social media, self-media, etc., and bravely start planning. Only in this way can you truly seize those opportunities.</p>
